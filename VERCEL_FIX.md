# Vercel Deployment Fix - Summary

## What Was Wrong

Your Vercel deployment was **NOT** a Supabase/database issue. The actual error was:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/app' 
imported from /var/task/api/index.js
```

The `api/index.ts` serverless function was trying to import `createExpressApp` from `../server/app`, but when deployed to Vercel, that file wasn't being bundled into the deployment package. The database connection code never even had a chance to run!

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created Build Script (`scripts/build-vercel.sh`)
- Properly bundles the `api/index.ts` serverless function with all its dependencies
- Includes the `server/app` code that was missing
- Now creates a complete `api/index.js` file (1.9MB) with everything needed

### 2. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed build command to use the new build script
- This ensures proper bundling during Vercel deployment

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment bundling"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
After pushing to GitHub, Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new build configuration.

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel (Settings → Environment Variables):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
- `OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS` - Your wallet address
- `VITE_OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS` - Same wallet address
- `BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL` - https://mainnet.base.org

**Important:** Make sure "Production" is checked ✅ for each variable!

### Step 4: Redeploy Again (if variables were just added)
If you just added/changed environment variables, click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment. Environment variables only apply to NEW deployments.

## Expected Result

After redeployment:
1. No more "Cannot find module" errors
2. Database should connect successfully
3. API endpoints should work (`/api/current-link`, `/frame`, etc.)
4. Your Farcaster frame should load properly

## Verification

Check the Runtime Logs in Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click latest deployment
2. Click "Runtime Logs" tab
3. You should see: `✓ Database connected. Links count: X`

If you still see database errors after this, THEN it would be a Supabase configuration issue. But the module error should be completely resolved.

## Questions?

If you still have issues after following these steps, share the new runtime logs and I can help debug further.
